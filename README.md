# Crop-Recommendation

### Crop Recommendation using Random Forest Classifier

This repository contains an implementation of a crop recommendation system using the Random Forest classifier algorithm. The system uses machine learning techniques to predict the most suitable crop for a given set of environmental and soil conditions.

### Introduction :  
Choosing the right crop for a specific agricultural area is crucial for maximizing yields and ensuring sustainable farming practices. The Crop Recommendation system leverages the Random Forest classifier to analyze historical data and make predictions about the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil conditions.

### Dataset :  
The dataset used for training and evaluation of the Crop Recommendation system is not included in this repository. However, you can use your own dataset by following the format described below:

The dataset should be in a tabular format such as CSV, with each row representing a sample and each column representing a feature.
The dataset should include the following features:
N (Nitrogen)
P (Phosphorus)
K (Potassium)
temperature
humidity
ph (Soil pH)
rainfall
crop (Target variable - the crop type)

### Algorithm :  
The Crop Recommendation system utilizes the Random Forest classifier algorithm, a popular machine learning technique for classification tasks. Random Forest creates an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is built on a randomly selected subset of the training data.

The Random Forest classifier is trained using a labeled dataset, where each sample is associated with a specific crop type. The classifier learns patterns and relationships between input features and corresponding crop types, enabling it to make predictions for new, unseen data.

### Evaluation :  
The performance of the Crop Recommendation system can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics measure the system's ability to correctly predict the most suitable crop based on the given conditions.

During the development process, it is important to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This allows for unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. Cross-validation techniques can also be used to ensure the robustness of the model.
